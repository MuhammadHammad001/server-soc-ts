# RISC-V Server SoC Compliance Test Suite

  Under Constructions.

## ARM Base System Architecture Compliance Suite (BSA-ACS)

This suite will build on ARM BSA ACS (Architecture Compliance Suite), for more information about ARM BSA-ACS, please refer to [https://github.com/ARM-software/bsa-acs](https://github.com/ARM-software/bsa-acs). 


## RISC-V Server SoC Spec

The RISC-V server SoC specification defines a standardized set of capabilities that portable system software such as operating systems and hypervisors, can rely on being present in a RISC-V server SoC. For the spec information, please refer to [https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/server-soc](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/server-soc).


## RISC-V Server SoC Test Spec

Along with the Server SoC Spec, there is a test spec which defines a set of tests to verify if the requirements specified in RISC-V Server SoC specification are implemented. This test suite will be designed based on the test spec. For more information about the test spec, please also refer to [https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/server-soc](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/server-soc).
